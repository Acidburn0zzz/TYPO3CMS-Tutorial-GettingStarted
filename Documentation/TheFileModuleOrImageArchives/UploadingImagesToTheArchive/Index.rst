Uploading images to the archive
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One way to get images to the archive would be through FTP. But of
course you can upload directly in the File module. Just click the
folder icons:

|img-141|

This will bring up a Flash-Popup form where you can upload multiple
files at once:

|img-142|

If your browser does not support flash, you can disable this feature
in your user settings and you will get an Simple Upload-Form.

Likewise files can be renamed, copied, deleted etc - all by the
functions available in the context menus you are familiar with
already:

|img-144|
