Note on image processing in TYPO3
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are not so lucky you didn't see some of the images in these
screenshots on your own server. This might be because ImageMagick was
not properly detected on your server. You probably didn't see all the
great things happen.

You will have to consult the `:underline:`installation documentation`
<http://typo3.org/documentation/document-
library/guides/doc_guide_install/current/>`_ available to get those
problems solved. Also remember there is a `:underline:`mailing list
for installation`  <http://lists.typo3.org/cgi-
bin/mailman/listinfo/typo3-install>`_ questions.
