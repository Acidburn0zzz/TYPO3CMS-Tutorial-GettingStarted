Backend and Frontend
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TYPO3 is divided in two areas - the backend and the frontend. While
the frontend is for everyone out there on the web - it is the website
TYPO3 produces - only you are allowed access to the backend - the
administrative area of the website. A username and password is always
required for the backend. You will later learn how to give access to
the backend to others - like editors or co-administrators.

To go to the frontend, enter "http://www.your-site.example.org/"in
your address bar. For now continue with the backend.

Go to the backend of your new website: open a browser and type
"http://www.your-site.example.org/typo3/".

You will get a login page looking like this:

TYPO3.

After pressing the login button you get redirected to the TYPO3
backend overview.

On the left you have TYPO3's main modules - the main menu of the
backend. Click on "Page" to go to the page module now.
