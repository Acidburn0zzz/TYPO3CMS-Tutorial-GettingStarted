Backend and Frontend
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TYPO3 is divided in two areas - the backend and the frontend. While
the frontend is for everyone out there on the web - it is the website
TYPO3 produces - only you are allowed access to the backend - the
administrative area of the website. A username and password is always
required for the backend. You will later learn how to give access to
the backend to others - like editors or co-administrators.

To go to the frontend, enter "http://www.your-site.example.org/"in
your address bar. For now continue with the backend.

Go to the backend of your new website: open a browser and type
"http://www.your-site.example.org/typo3/".

You will get a login page looking like this:

   :alt: Login page for the backend.

Use the username "admin" and the password you set when installing
TYPO3.

After pressing the login button you get redirected to the TYPO3
backend overview.

On the left you have TYPO3's main modules - the main menu of the
backend. Click on "Page" to go to the page module now.
