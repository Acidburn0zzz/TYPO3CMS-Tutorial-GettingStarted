Prerequisite
^^^^^^^^^^^^

You should have a fully configured and ready web server meeting the
requirements you find at `http://typo3.org/about/typo3
-the-cms/system-requirements/ <http://typo3.org/about/typo3-the-cms/system-requirements/>`_ .

If you do not have a web server and you are running a Windows
operation system, you might want to try the
`TYPO3Winstaller <http://typo3winstaller.sourceforge.net/>`_ ,
which will install a web
server and the Introduction Package on your local computer.
