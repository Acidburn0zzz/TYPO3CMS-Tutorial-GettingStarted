----------

TYPO3 CMS has a lot of documentation available on the
`documentation web site <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/>`_.
The documentation is divided into several sections:

1. `Tutorials <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/Tutorials.html>`_
   section covers documents which provide step-by-step
   introductions to specific topics.
2. `Guides <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/Guides.html>`_
   cover topics in more depth, like installation or security.
3. The `References <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/References.html>`_
   are related to the core of TYPO3 CMS and drill into details.
   They also provide extensive references (hence their name) about configurations and APIs.
4. The `Extensions <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/>`_ gathers all
   manuals related to core and public extensions.

This is admittedly a huge mass of documentation and you may feel lost
about where to look next. We recommend the following documents for further studies
after this tutorial:
